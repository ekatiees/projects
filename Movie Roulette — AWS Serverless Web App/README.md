# ðŸŽ¬ Movie Roulette â€” AWS Serverless Web App
Movie Roulette is a serverless movie recommendation web application.
The app uses AWS Amplify for the front-end, AWS Lambda for serverless
backend functions, and AWS DynamoDB for storage. Users interact with
the app through a web interface, which is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

Please, follow the link to see the app up and running:

## Hereâ€™s how the app works

</div>

1. User interacts with the app through a web interface. They can push
the "Get a random movie" button, which will fetch a random movie
from a collection of 2000 most popular movies ranked by TMDB and stored
in their databases. Alternatively, they can sign up / sign in and
compile/see their watchlist.

</div>

2. The request is routed to the appropriate API Gateway endpoint and to
   an AWS Lambda function.

3. Lambda function gets triggered and processes the request.There are five functions:
> * getRandomMovie: retrieves a random movie from TMDB,
> * saveToWatchlist: saves a movie to the user's watchlist,
> * getWatchlist: retrieves the user's watchlist,
> * removeFromWatchlist: removes a movie from the user's watchlist,
> * getAIAnswer: answers any user's question about the given movie with the help of Gemini.

4. The Lambda functions interact with a DynamoDB table to store and retrieve
   movie data and user watchlist data.

</div>

5. The API Gateway sends the response from the Lambda function back to
   the user's browser and the user enjoys the experience.

Enjoy!
